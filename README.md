This was a homework exercise for C#/.NEt at NSS.

Create a class that contains information about employees of a company and define methods to get/set employee name, job title, and start date.
Consider the concept of aggregation, and modify the Company class so that you assign employees to a company.
In the Main method, create a company, and three employees, and then assign the employees to the company.
Update the Company class to write the name of each employee to the console. Consider a method named ListEmployees().
